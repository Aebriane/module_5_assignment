# Hello fellow avenger, welcome to the multiverse initiative aka M.I..
## We must follow these steps in order to research more about the multiverse
*To do this*
1. Contact Dr.Strange
2. Contact Wanda
3. Contact Wong
4. Watch the first Dr.Strange movie if you haven't already, like bruh, you should've watched it already. You livin under a rock? Or the rock? Do you smell what he is cooking? 
### Do you think that there should be any changes in the to do list? If so, edit the list as you may, and I will discuss this with the avengers. How do I know them? I don't. 
### Idk how I am going to get it to them but yeah. Life is rough.
